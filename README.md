# Cflex_analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for analyzing protein flexibility data generated with **CABS-Flex 3.0**.  

The script calculates:
- **RMSD** (Root Mean Square deviation)  
- **RMSF** (Root Mean Square Fluctuation)  
- **ΔSASA** (difference in Solvent Accessible Surface Area)  

## Contents
- `D_SASA.ipynb` → Notebook with the RMS, RMSF, and ΔSASA calculations from CABS-Flex output.

## Usage
Open the notebook in **Jupyter Lab** or **Jupyter Notebook**, load the results from **CABS-Flex 3.0**, and run the cells to perform the analysis.
